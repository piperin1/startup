# MyPet
**Elevator Pitch**
> Imagine a virtual pet that you can feed and care for, accessible right from your browser. MyPet lets users log in, interact with their pet by performing simple actions like feeding and playing, and watch the pet's happiness and hunger levels change in real-time. The app saves your progress so you can return to your pet later. With fun animations and real-world data like weather influencing the petâ€™s environment, it's a light, interactive experience for anyone who loves casual gaming and virtual pets.
